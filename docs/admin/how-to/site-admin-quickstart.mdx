# Initial Configuration Quickstart

Sourcegraph is a highly configurable platform that allows you to tailor its various features to your organization's needs.

As with any highly customizable product, the numerous options can feel overwhelming. This Quickstart guide is designed to walk you through the essential steps and considerations to efficiently set up and launch your instance after deployment.

## Getting Started:

#### Step 1: Familiarize yourself with the Admin Site Configurations


The Site Configuration is where admins are able to adjust the global settings of the Sourcegraph instance to better align its functionality with their organization's requirements and needs.  

**View and edit the site configuration:**
- Navigate to **User menu** > **Site admin**.
- Open the **Configuration page**. 


For a complete reference of configuration options, please visit [Site Config References](https://sourcegraph.com/docs/admin/config/site_config).


#### Step 2: Connect a Code Host

Configuring connections to your code host(s) and repositories is how Sourcegraph accesses and makes your code searchable for your users. 

Once connected, Sourcegraph will clone and index your configured repos so that users can search and navigate across them. 

**To get started:**
- Navigate to **User menu** > **Site admin** > **Code hosts connections**
- Select the **"Add connection"** button at the top right.
- Follow the instructions to connect your code host.

Please note that the initial clone and indexing of your code will not be instantaneous and may take a notable amount of time depending on the size and number of repos youâ€™re connecting.


For more specific and detailed reference, please visit [Code Host Connections Specifics](https://sourcegraph.com/docs/admin/code_hosts).


#### Step 3: Configure User Authentication & Repo Permissions

Along with connecting your code hosts and syncing your repositories, Sourcegraph can be configured to use your preferred SSO or sign-in method, and can inherit and enforcing repository permissions for users. 


To get started with authentication and confirming repo permissions, please reference the following: 


- [User Authentication & SSO](https://sourcegraph.com/docs/admin/auth)


- [Repo Permissions](https://sourcegraph.com/docs/admin/permissions)


#### Step 4: Set up Code Navigation *(Recommended)*

Code Navigation allows you to do more than just search your code. It helps you quickly understand your code, its dependencies, and its symbols.

While this step is not required, it is highly recommended to help your users navigate and understand your codebase, as well as provide additional context to Cody if you have it enabled. 

To get started with Precise Code Navigation, please reference [Code Navigation](https://sourcegraph.com/docs/code-search/code-navigation).


#### Step 5: Familiarize yourself with Monitoring Dashboard and Options

Your Sourcegraph instance is shipped with monitoring with Grafana. Only admins have access to the Grafana dashboard.

**Viewing the Grafana dashboard:**
- Navigate to **User menu** > **Site admin** > **Monitoring**

**Some additional resources:**
- [Dashboard Reference](https://sourcegraph.com/docs/admin/observability/dashboards)
- [Alerts Reference](https://sourcegraph.com/docs/admin/observability/alerts)


#### Step 6: Invite Users and Promote Additional Admins

After the above are complete, users are able to sign in to Sourcegraph and begin searching and navigating their code.

While this is completely optional, you can promote users to admin by doing the following:
- Navigate to **User menu** > **Site admin** > **Users & Auth** > **Users**
- Search for the user you'd like to promote
- Under **Actions** select **Promote to admin**
