# Sourcegraph Administration Guide

Welcome to the Sourcegraph administration guide. This guide covers deploying, managing, and troubleshooting a Sourcegraph instance.

## Introduction - Understanding Sourcegraph as an Admin

Managing a Sourcegraph instance involves more than just deploying it. It's about understanding how Sourcegraph works, configuring it for your organization's needs, and ensuring its smooth operation. This guide will walk you through the entire lifecycle of managing a Sourcegraph instance, from deployment to maintenance and troubleshooting.

## Overview of key features

### Code Search

Sourcegraph's [code search](../code-search/index.md) feature allows you to search across your entire codebase, including private repositories. It's a powerful tool for finding code, understanding code, and understanding codebases.

### Code Intelligence

Sourcegraph's [code intelligence and navigation features](../code_navigation/index.md) provide developers with powerful tools to understand and navigate codebases efficiently. Code intelligence offers precise code navigation, including go-to-definition, find references, and hover tooltips, which work across repositories and languages. This feature enables developers to quickly explore code relationships, understand function calls, and trace code paths. These features are particularly valuable for large, complex codebases, helping teams to onboard faster, debug more effectively, and make informed decisions during code reviews and refactoring efforts.

### Batch Changes

[Batch Changes](../batch_changes/index.md) is a powerful feature that allows you to make changes to multiple repositories at once. It's a great way to automate repetitive tasks, such as updating dependencies or applying code changes across multiple repositories.

### Code Insights

[Code Insights](../code_insights/index.md) is a powerful feature that allows you to visualize and analyze code metrics and trends. It's a great way to get a high-level overview of your codebase and identify areas for improvement.

### Code Monitors

Code monitors are a powerful feature that allows you to monitor for specific events in your codebase. It's a great way to get notified when certain events occur, such as a new issue being created or a pull request being merged.

### Cody

[Cody](../cody/index.md) is a powerful AI-powered code assistant that helps developers write code faster and more accurately. It's a great way to get started with AI-powered code assistance.

## Cody Overview (Admin-Foused)

### Cody Clients

#### Cody Web

[Cody Web](../cody/clients/cody-with-sourcegraph.md) is a web-based client for chatting with Cody. It's a great way to get started with Cody, or if a user's preferred IDEs are not available.

#### Cody IDE Plugins

Cody is available as IDE plugins for [VS Code](../cody/clients/install-vscode.md) and [JetBrains](../cody/clients/install-jetbrains.md) IDEs. Other IDEs such as Neovim, Eclipse, and Visual Studio currently have early experimental support.

### Cody Model Configuration

Cody is powered by large language models (LLM). Depending on your deployment configuration, different models are available for use. Learn more [here](../cody/clients/model-configuration.md).

## Advanced Feature Overview

### Search Contexts

[Search contexts](../code-search/search-contexts.md) enable you to create customized search scopes by pinning specific sets of repositories. This feature provides a quick and efficient way to focus your searches on relevant codebases, enhancing productivity and streamlining the search process.

### Organizations

[Organizations](../admin/organizations.md) are named groups of users. Orgs with search scopes, saved queries, etc.. These settings take effect for all users who are members of the organization.

### Repo Metadata

[Repo metadata](../admin/repo-metadata.md) is a powerful feature that allows you to add metadata about your repositories to Sourcegraph. This metadata can be used to filter and search by data unique to your organization.

### Code Ownership

[Code ownership](../admin/code_ownership.md) is aimed at helping find the right person and team to contact, for any question, at any time.

### Prompt Library

The [prompt library](../cody/prompt-library.md) feature in Cody allows users to create, manage, and use custom prompts for specific tasks or workflows. Prompts can be shared across the organization.

## Effectively Running Sourcegraph For Your Organization

### Best Practices

### Admin Analytics

The analytics section helps Sourcegraph administrators understand user engagement across the various Sourcegraph features, identify power users, and convey value to internal leaders.

There are two parts to analytics:

- [Code Search Analytics](../admin/docs/admin/analytics)
- [Cody Analytics](../cody/clients/enable-cody-enterprise.md#analytics)
