# Sourcegraph Administration Guide

Welcome to the Sourcegraph administration guide. This guide covers deploying, managing, and troubleshooting a Sourcegraph instance.

## Introduction - Understanding Sourcegraph as an Admin

Managing a Sourcegraph instance involves more than just deploying it. It's about understanding how Sourcegraph works, configuring it for your organization's needs, and ensuring its smooth operation. This guide will walk you through the entire lifecycle of managing a Sourcegraph instance, from deployment to maintenance and troubleshooting. For a comprehensive list of administrative links, see the [Administration Links Directory](../admin/links.md).

## Deploying Sourcegraph

### Choosing the Right Deployment Method

Sourcegraph provides a variety of managed and self hosted deployment methods to meet your organizational, operational, and technical needs including Sourcegraph Cloud, Kubernetes, and Docker Compose. You can see an overview of the available options, along with Sourcegraph's recommendations given your specific requirements, at the [Deployment Overview](../admin/deploy/index.md) page.

### Deployment Options

#### Sourcegraph Cloud
[Sourcegraph Cloud](/docs/cloud/index.md) is Sourcegraph's managed service and the prefered deployment solution for a majority of organizations. With Cloud, Sourcegraph takes the burden of deploying, monitoring and managing infrastrucutre, and upgrading the instance so you can focus on making sure your users are getting the most out of the tool.

#### Kubernetes

For self hosted customer willing and able to deploy a multi-node solution, Kubernetes is the prefered method as it is the most vetted, robust, and scalable option. Sourcegraph primarily deploys with Kubernetes Helm, and a complete guide to do so can be found [here](../admin/deploy/kubernetes.md). If you have organizational requirements to deploy Kubernetes Kustomize, the option is available and documented [here](../admin/deploy/kubernetes/kustomize.md), though this should be discussed with your account representatives.

#### Docker Compose

For a simplified, single-node self hosted deployment option, Sourcegraph uses [Docker Compose](/admin/deploy/docker-compose).

#### Other

A variety of other deployment methods are available for specific circumstances. If you are considering these deployment methods, please discuss with your account representatives. These methods include:
- [Machine Images](../admin/deploy/machine-images.md) - Good for purchasing Sourcegraph directly through a Cloud Provider's marketplace, or for specific, quick self hosted deployment scenarios.
- [Docker Single Container](../admin/deploy/docker-single-container.md) - Typically only used for small, non-production deployments and validation.

## High-Level Overview of Key Features

### Code Search

Sourcegraph's [code search](../code-search/index.md) feature allows you to search across your entire codebase, including private repositories. It's a powerful tool for finding code, understanding code, and understanding codebases.

### Code Intelligence

Sourcegraph's [code intelligence and navigation features](../code_navigation/index.md) provide developers with powerful tools to understand and navigate codebases efficiently. Code intelligence offers precise code navigation, including go-to-definition, find references, and hover tooltips, which work across repositories and languages. This feature enables developers to quickly explore code relationships, understand function calls, and trace code paths. These features are particularly valuable for large, complex codebases, helping teams to onboard faster, debug more effectively, and make informed decisions during code reviews and refactoring efforts.

### Batch Changes

[Batch Changes](../batch_changes/index.md) is a powerful feature that allows you to make changes to multiple repositories at once. It's a great way to automate repetitive tasks, such as updating dependencies or applying code changes across multiple repositories.

### Code Insights

[Code Insights](../code_insights/index.md) is a powerful feature that allows you to visualize and analyze code metrics and trends. It's a great way to get a high-level overview of your codebase and identify areas for improvement.

### Code Monitors

Code monitors are a powerful feature that allows you to monitor for specific events in your codebase. It's a great way to get notified when certain events occur, such as a new issue being created or a pull request being merged.

### Cody

[Cody](../cody/index.md) is a powerful AI-powered code assistant that helps developers write code faster and more accurately. It's a great way to get started with AI-powered code assistance.

## Cody Overview (Admin-Foused)

### Cody Clients

#### Cody Web

[Cody Web](../cody/clients/cody-with-sourcegraph.md) is a web-based client for chatting with Cody. It's a great way to get started with Cody, or if a user's preferred IDEs are not available.

#### Cody IDE Plugins

Cody is available as IDE plugins for [VS Code](../cody/clients/install-vscode.md) and [JetBrains](../cody/clients/install-jetbrains.md) IDEs. Other IDEs such as Neovim, Eclipse, and Visual Studio currently have early experimental support.

### Cody Model Configuration

Cody is powered by large language models (LLM). Depending on your deployment configuration, different models are available for use. Learn more [here](../cody/clients/model-configuration.md).

## Advanced Feature Overview

### Search Contexts

[Search contexts](../code-search/search-contexts.md) enable you to create customized search scopes by pinning specific sets of repositories. This feature provides a quick and efficient way to focus your searches on relevant codebases, enhancing productivity and streamlining the search process.

### Organizations

[Organizations](../admin/organizations.md) are named groups of users. Orgs with search scopes, saved queries, etc.. These settings take effect for all users who are members of the organization.

### Repo Metadata

[Repo metadata](../admin/repo-metadata.md) is a powerful feature that allows you to add metadata about your repositories to Sourcegraph. This metadata can be used to filter and search by data unique to your organization.

### Code Ownership

[Code ownership](../admin/code_ownership.md) is aimed at helping find the right person and team to contact, for any question, at any time.

### Prompt Library

The [prompt library](../cody/prompt-library.md) feature in Cody allows users to create, manage, and use custom prompts for specific tasks or workflows. Prompts can be shared across the organization.

## Maintaining Your Instance

### Upgrading

### Monitoring and Observing Sourcegraph
One key component to managing a Sourcegraph instance is having the ability to observe, monitor, and analyze the health of your instance. Sourcegraph ships with [Grafana](https://grafana.com/) for dashboards; [Prometheus](https://prometheus.io/) for metrics and alerting; as well as a [built-in alerting system.](/admin/observability/alerting)

### Viewing instance health and metrics
Alerts and metrics can be viewed and monitored in Grafana. To access the Grafana dashboard bundled with your Sourcegraph instance, go to **User menu > Site admin > Monitoring**.
