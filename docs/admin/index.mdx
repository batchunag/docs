## Overview of key features

### Code Search

Sourcegraph's code search feature allows you to search across your entire codebase, including private repositories. It's a powerful tool for finding code, understanding code, and understanding codebases.

### Code Intelligence

Sourcegraph's code intelligence and navigation features provide developers with powerful tools to understand and navigate codebases efficiently. Code intelligence offers precise code navigation, including go-to-definition, find references, and hover tooltips, which work across repositories and languages. This feature enables developers to quickly explore code relationships, understand function calls, and trace code paths. These features are particularly valuable for large, complex codebases, helping teams to onboard faster, debug more effectively, and make informed decisions during code reviews and refactoring efforts.

### Batch Changes

Batch Changes is a powerful feature that allows you to make changes to multiple repositories at once. It's a great way to automate repetitive tasks, such as updating dependencies or applying code changes across multiple repositories.

### Code Insights

Code Insights is a powerful feature that allows you to visualize and analyze code metrics and trends. It's a great way to get a high-level overview of your codebase and identify areas for improvement.

### Code Monitors

Code monitors are a powerful feature that allows you to monitor for specific events in your codebase. It's a great way to get notified when certain events occur, such as a new issue being created or a pull request being merged.

### Cody

Cody is a powerful AI-powered code assistant that helps developers write code faster and more accurately. It's a great way to get started with AI-powered code assistance.
